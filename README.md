Awkward Conversations
====================

So awkward! Wow!

What it is?
--------------------

It is an app that makes yr conversations awkward without you having to say anything.  It 
does this by reading random YouTube comments out loud.  You never know whether it's going
to say something completely normal, or go off on a racist rant!  Such fun!


How can has?
--------------------

Welll, this app is, by design, a buggy obnoxious piece of crap.  So it will probably never be allowed in the Play Store.  To install it, you're gonna need a recent (1.0ish) version of Android Studio.  You can clone the repo, open it in yr studio, and send it to yr phone wit by debugging it.

It crashed, wat do?
--------------------

Turn it off and turn it on again.

Why it stupid?
-------------------

U might be wondering why some stupid things r, like Le Wrong Package Name and Le Wrong Speled Werds.  This is
all in the spirt of Le YouTube Comment, duhhhhh.
